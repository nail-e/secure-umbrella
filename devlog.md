## 3/2/2022
----------
I've created this project for fun, i'm planning to finish this by end of this month, with features such as: 
- Create password
    - Restrict, remove characters
    - Choose length
    - Choose security
- Store created password
- Input pre-existing password
So far, i haven't written any code, I am planning the process for how this program is going to work. If I were to progress any further, i'd need to learn how to get a variable from another file.

## 4/2/2022
Created main.py and the main folder. How I plan for this to work is that there's separate functions which can be accessed using the main.py file. I believe this modular programming would be easier for me to focus on one function at a time. 

## 5/2/2022
After spending a whole day on this project, I have finished the main code of createpassword.py. A password can now be generated with 3 criteria by user's choice: Length, Security Type & Characters omitted. Now, what's left is to be able to save those passwords in the same directory the program is running in. The hard part's over though, maybe I don't need the end of the month for the first release.

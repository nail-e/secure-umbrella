## 3/2/2022
----------
I've created this project for fun, i'm planning to finish this by end of this month, with features such as: \
- Create password
    - Restrict, remove characters
    - Choose length
    - Choose security
- Store created password
- Input pre-existing password
So far, i haven't written any code, I am planning the process for how this program is going to work. If I were to progress any further, i'd need to learn how to get a variable from another file.
